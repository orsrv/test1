# My Git Project

## Description
Welcome to my Git project! In this project, I will be showcasing my coding skills and collaborating with other developers. I will be using Git, a distributed version control system, to manage and track changes to my codebase.

## Features
- Version control: Git allows me to keep track of all the changes I make to my code. I can easily revert back to previous versions if needed.
- Branching: With Git, I can create multiple branches to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously. This helps me keep my codebase organized and allows for easy collaboration with other developers.
- Collaboration: Git enables me to collaborate with other developers by easily merging their changes into my codebase. I can also review their code and provide feedback using pull requests.
